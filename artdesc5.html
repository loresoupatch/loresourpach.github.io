<p style="color: #006699;text-align:center;">Originaly a project for my horror
  literature class in school, I created my own version of Supernatural themed
  Monoploy. The name Omnoply is derived from the latin root "Omn" which was used
  in several magic spell encantations through the television series.</p>
